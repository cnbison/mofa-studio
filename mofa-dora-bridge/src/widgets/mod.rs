//! Widget-specific bridge implementations
//!
//! Each widget type has its own bridge that connects to dora as a dynamic node:
//! - `mofa-audio-player`: Receives audio, forwards to UI for playback
//! - `mofa-system-log`: Receives logs from multiple nodes
//! - `mofa-prompt-input`: Sends user prompts to LLM
//!
//! Note: LED visualization is calculated in screen.rs from output waveform
//! (more accurate since it reflects what's actually being played)
